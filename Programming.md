## Patterns
### 𝐒𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐨𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
1. [How to use the Singleton Pattern in Multithreading in .NET](https://stefandjokic.tech/posts/how-to-use-singleton-in-multithreading)

### 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Defines an interface for creating an object, but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating an instance of it.

### 𝐀𝐛𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐅𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### 𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐨𝐭𝐲𝐩𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

### 𝐀𝐝𝐚𝐩𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.

### 𝐃𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to sub classing for extending functionality.

### 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

### 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐲 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

### 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧
Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the parameters.
