## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This is an Awesome List of Computer Science, Technology, Programming and Educational resources for the benefit of all who care to use it. Some resources may be tailored towards specific localities or niche subjects; but that doesn't mean that the list is just for those people. The list is made available by [Closebracket](https://github.com/closebracket), the director of Parentull as he believes that everyone in society should benefit from techology and life long learning.
