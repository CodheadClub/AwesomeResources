## Hypervisors and virtual machines  <a name="virtualisation"></a>

Ontop of the great VMware resources below there are other hypervisors for running containers and virtual machines.

Hypervisors are classified as Type 1 or Type 2 hypervisors. Type 1 are often known as bare metal hypervisors. It's installed on bare metal, e.g. it is not installed as an application on top of an operating system. A Type 2 hypervisor is an application which is installed on the operating system.
Type 2 Hypervisors can be SLOW.  In most reviews and experience, they perform at roughly 30-40% hardware capability.  That means an Guest Operating Systems in a virtual machine hosted on a Type 2 hyperviosor will likely perform at best like it has an 800 MHz CPU if you have 2 GHz physical CPU. 

If you use a Type 1 Hypervisor, you get much better performance (based on experience and reviews) typically get 80-90% hardware capability - so that same virtual machines hosted on the same 2 GHz CPU should operate more like it has a 1.6 GHz CPU instead of 800 Mhz. 

Here are some type 1 and type 2 hypervisors.

## Andrew Hancock, Cyrus Computer Consultants Ltd <a name="andrewhancock"></a>
Andrew Hancock is VMware & Virtualisation Consultant in Apps, Servers & Storage at [Cyrus Computer Consultants Ltd.](https://www.cyrus-consultants.co.uk/) He also has a long list of VMware and Virtualisations articles, a passionate VMware Technical Architect, and VMware vExpert ***************** (2011-2025) and VMware vExpert PRO. (6 Years) He has won over 46+ [Experts Exchange Awards](https://www.experts-exchange.com/members/hanccocka.html) and is Overall Leader at [Experts Exchange](https://www.experts-exchange.com/) Experts Exchange - The Original Tech Community™ - Formed in 1996, Experts Exchange (EE) is one of the oldest online communities in the world. For 26 years, tech problem-solvers worldwide have gathered on EE to share knowledge and help each other succeed.

In 2010, I rekindled my relationship with Experts Exchange, the world’s premier tech community, after originally discovering it in 2003. What began as a simple search for help with an Outlook issue evolved into a transformative journey of learning, contribution, and recognition. Inspired by a close friend's passion for the platform, I dove headfirst into answering questions, focusing on VMware and virtualization.

Over the years, I achieved numerous milestones, from earning my first "Genius" t-shirt to topping the VMware leaderboard and becoming the No. 1 point earner on Experts Exchange. This article outlines my experiences, achievements, and the pivotal role Experts Exchange played in shaping my career. Read on [From Rookie to Elite: My 14-Year Journey at Experts Exchange](https://andysworld.org.uk/2024/09/17/from-rookie-to-elite-my-14-year-journey-at-experts-exchange/) to discover how a desire to contribute led to over a decade of success and personal growth within the tech community.

His articles are reproduced here for your reading pleasure. If you want to discuss anything VMware, then ask him! He will only be too happy to oblige. Unfortunately NFR and Evaluation software for VMware software products is coming to an end! Sadly on the 15th August 2024, Broadcom terminated the [VMware IT Academy Program](https://www.vmware.com/uk/company/it-academy.html). It was annouced at VMware Explore, Barcelona in 2024, there would be significant changes made to the VMUG Advantage EVALexperience and VMware vExpert programs, from 2025, the only method to obtain NFR licenses would be to train and become certified with a VCP-VVF or VCP-VCF. However in March 2025, Broadcom made available again the FREE ESXi and VMware Workstation Pro and Fusion for FREE !

[Hancock's VMware Half Hour Channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@einsteinagogo)

In this series based on VMware vSphere 7.0, which compliments the written articles above, Andrew Hancock demonstrates "HOW TO" on a variety of topics. All these videos are based on the previous written content at Experts Exchange.

In this short online course, there is a total of 40 hours of online videos from Part 1 to Part 75, taking you through the basics of VMware vSphere 7.0, from installation of the hypervisor (ESXi), creating Windows and Linux virtual machines, updating the ESXi hosts and installing and adding ESXi hosts to vCenter Server (the management server.)
This course is split over 75 parts, in bit size chunks, hosted by Andrew Hancock. If you have any questions or issues, then please consider posting a question on [Experts Exchange](https://www.experts-exchange.com/).

Hancock’s VMware Half Hour has grown beyond the original HOW TO series for vSphere 7.0 and 8.0, branching into related technologies that integrate with and enhance VMware environments. From backup and disaster recovery to automation, networking, and supporting infrastructure, the channel now explores the full ecosystem that wraps around VMware, helping professionals build complete, resilient, and efficient virtual infrastructures.

## **HOW TO: VMware vSphere 7.0**

A reminder that VMware vSphere 7.0 is End of Life in October 2025.
