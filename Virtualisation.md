## Hypervisors and virtual machines  <a name="virtualisation"></a>

Ontop of the great VMware resources below there are other hypervisors for running containers and virtual machines.

Hypervisors are classified as Type 1 or Type 2 hypervisors. Type 1 are often known as bare metal hypervisors. It's installed on bare metal, e.g. it is not installed as an application on top of an operating system. A Type 2 hypervisor is an application which is installed on the operating system.
Type 2 Hypervisors can be SLOW.  In most reviews and experience, they perform at roughly 30-40% hardware capability.  That means an Guest Operating Systems in a virtual machine hosted on a Type 2 hyperviosor will likely perform at best like it has an 800 MHz CPU if you have 2 GHz physical CPU. 

If you use a Type 1 Hypervisor, you get much better performance (based on experience and reviews) typically get 80-90% hardware capability - so that same virtual machines hosted on the same 2 GHz CPU should operate more like it has a 1.6 GHz CPU instead of 800 Mhz. 

Here are some type 1 and type 2 hypervisors.

Type 1 (Bare Metal Hypervisors)

### Hancock's VMware Half Hour HOW TO Video Series

In this series based on VMware vSphere 7.0, which compliments the written articles above, Andrew Hancock demonstrates "HOW TO" on a variety of topics. All these videos are based on the previous written content at Experts Exchange.

In this short online course, there is a total of 15 hours of online videos from Part 1 to Part 35, taking you through the basics of VMware vSphere 7.0, from installation of the hypervisor (ESXi), creating Windows and Linux virtual machines, updating the ESXi hosts and installing and adding ESXi hosts to vCenter Server (the management server.)
This course is split over 35 parts, in bit size chunks, hosted by Andrew Hancock. If you have any questions or issues, then please consider posting a question on [Experts Exchange](https://www.experts-exchange.com/).
