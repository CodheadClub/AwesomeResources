# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Freeside is overseen by the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk) and we will abide by University policy and UK Law where applicable.

## Our Guidelines

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Submitting malicious or poor quality pull requests.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment (joking is ok)
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
